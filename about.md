My name is Nick Ethier and I'm a husband and father, ops guy, coder and open source enthusiast.
I've had the amazing opportunity to work on the [LogStash](http://logstash.net) project among others.
These days I'm found hacking on infrastructure and networking code at [Jive](http://jive.com).

You can often find me working on ways to bridge the gap between containerization and networking.
However my recreational coding gets nice -n 19 so I can spend time with my amazing wife and kids.
